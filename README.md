Meerkat All The Things

![Screenshot](multimeer.gif "Screenshot")

Got bored, messed around with Meerkat. I like it, but wanted to see all the things.  Meerkat FOMO. Now you can watch all the live meerkats at once.

It will update every 5 seconds looking for new streams, and remove old busted streams.

## How do I run this?

I tested on my iPad Air, and it did seem to work...but haven't done extensive testing. Also, if there are alot of streams, it will use quite a bit of bandwidth. So...yeah. But hey, if you wanna learn about AVFoundation or just hack on some video code, have at it.

```
pod install
```

Then run in XCode.

## Usage

- Tap a cell to listen to just that stream, tap again to listen to everything

## TODO

-  Run on iPhone, with 75px streams
-  Tap to show just one stream
-  Maybe push to AppStore for external Testflight testing
-  Some way to jump into the "real" stream
-  Code is super messy, especially the main view controller.
