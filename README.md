Meerkat All The Things

![Screenshot](multimeer.gif "Screenshot")

Got bored, messed around with Meerkat. I like it, but wanted to see all the things.  Meerkat FOMO. Now you can watch all the live meerkats at once.

It will update every 5 seconds looking for new streams, and remove old busted streams.

## Usage

- Tap a cell to listen to just that stream & see details on broadcaster, tap again to listen to everything
- Tap action icon in nav bar to view the stream in the Meerkat app
- App settings to change number of concurrent streams (defaults to 10)

## TODO

-  Tracking all enhancements/bugs in issues
